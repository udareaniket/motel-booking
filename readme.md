This is a simple demo to portray a motel booking system using AngularJS, HTML and CSS.

Conditions for calculating the final cost:
● The motel has two levels.
● Because the second level is only accessible via an outdoor staircase, rooms on this level
are not handicap accessible.
● Rooms can have 1, 2, or 3 beds, at the following nightly costs:
○ 1 bed - $50 per night
○ 2 beds - $75 per night
○ 3 beds - $90 per night
● The motel allows guests to bring pets, but they charge $20 per pet and limit it to 2 pets
maximum. Also, because some pets are messy, pets are only allowed on the ground
floor so that cleaning is easier to perform if necessary.
